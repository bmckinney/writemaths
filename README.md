Write maths, see maths is a sort-of-WYSIWYG editor for HTML+LaTeX maths.

It's implemented using [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org)

You can write maths in a simple BASIC-style syntax, or in raw LaTeX.

Text can be formatted using [Textile](http://textile.thresholdstate.com)

The editor exports nice clean HTML for easy pasting into things like blog posts.
